Hi there! Welcome to our adoption blog!

I (Ashlie) will be writing most of these because it's not Tom's sort of thing... but I will try to make him sit down and type out a few thoughts every now and then. Wish me luck on that one, he's not a big "blogger" type of guy.

We are so thrilled with our decision, and even <span style="text-decoration: underline;">more</span> thrilled that we finally spilled the beans and can now talk about it! I personally feel the same giddiness to announce that we are "Paper Pregnant" (that's what the cool folks in the adoption-world call it, and I kind of dig it) as I did to announce that we were pregnant! I know some of you might be thinking, "She never announced she was pregnant?" and you're kind of right. We didn't send out a fancy letter and photo like we did for our adoption... but that's a post for another day. <em>Some of you are also thinking "I didn't get a fancy letter and photo!" and that's because we <del>forgot about you</del> didn't have your address in time. Sorry!</em>

Thomas and I have been quite busy with paperwork. As you can imagine, it's not the easiest to just up and adopt a child or children from a different country. We've been doing background checks, being fingerprinted, physicals...even Ruby (our mini golden doodle) had to have a special form signed by the vet stating that she will <em>not</em> eat our children. So this is our lives the last few weeks:

These next two were our completed home study binder. It took us a few weeks to get all of the background checks (had to be fingerprinted/checked in every county/state we've lived in the last 5 years). It also contained a whole bunch of financial records, an autobiography on each of us (6 pages long! It had to have a lot in it), as well as references and other stuff.

This is me turning in our home study binder at MLJ. I was going to take a photo of me infront of the big door/sign at MLJ (they have an incredibly beautiful old revitalized office in downtown Indy)... but when I was about to take the photo I noticed there was a security camera in the entryway. No blog is worth getting caught on camera taking a selfie!

We were contacted this week by MLJ, and our home visit has been scheduled for <em>this</em> Saturday! They say to not be nervous, but I'm nervous. I have some cleaning to do and some fire extinguishers to buy (who really has those around?) I am excited to get this one over with and get approved. Once we're approved there are a lot of grants and things we can apply for... not to mention we can't start on our dossier until we have an approved home study. (Check out our <a title="FAQ’s" href="http://hartgraveshaven.mkweddingstory.com/?page_id=63">FAQ</a> section if you have no clue what a dossier is)

And this is how excited Ruby gets about paperwork:

Thanks for reading! More to come after this weekends Home Study visit.... wish us luck. YIKES!
