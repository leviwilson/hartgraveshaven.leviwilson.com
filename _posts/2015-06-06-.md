This whole adoption process has been a lot of 'hurry up and wait' type of stuff... but waiting in general has been the opposite. It started with the wait, and now that we have our referral, we are in hurry mode!

This week has been unexpectedly amazing, but exhausting at the same time. We received our referral call on <a title="The most epic Tuesday. Ever." href="http://hartgraveshaven.mkweddingstory.com/?p=500">Tuesday</a>, Wednesday we had to get fingerprinted (again) for the FBI. Wednesday we did some paperwork. Thursday we paid an invoice. And Friday.... well Friday we bought our plane tickets!

That's right. I couldn't believe we already had travel dates for trip 1 either. But they must be ready to get us across the pond. I tell you, when Tom sent me the final itinerary I got a little teary eyed. We are so close to meeting our children for the first time. That's a moment I'm having a hard time wrapping my brain/heart around. I can't wait to hug them and hold them.
