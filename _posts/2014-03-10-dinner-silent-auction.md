We know it takes a village, and in our case it's going to take that plus some to help us bring our family together. We appreciate all of you who have stepped up and are willing to help. Thank you Jessica Chamberlin for organizing and heading up this fundraiser and also to the many other people, family and friends who are jumping in to make this night happen- honestly so many are helping and we don't even know who all of you are. We're humbled and grateful. From the very bottom of our hearts, we thank you. We love you. xoxo Tom &amp; Ashlie
