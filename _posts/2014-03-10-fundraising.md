Not sure quite yet how to organize this part, but for now I will be doing it this way.

We have three fundraisers in the works (2 larger ones and 1 smaller ongoing one). Click below to see info on each of them and per usual, more info is always coming!

Thomas and I also want to thank you all again for your immense support for our adoption. It is appreciated and welcomed. Most of all, we thank you for praying for our children and for our paperwork process. XOXO
