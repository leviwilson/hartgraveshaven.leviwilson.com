Our dear friend, Emily Miller, has offered to donate her incredible talents to do a mini-photo session or two and donate the funds to our adoption! We are so grateful to her for doing that, because we know how incredibly busy she is.
<ul>
	<li>Date is Friday, April 18, 2014 at a Noblesville Indiana Park</li>
	<li>Times will be from 5-7:40 and will be every 20 minutes. Many times are filled so please let me (or Emily if you know her) know what time you want and we'll let you know if available.</li>
	<li>She will be doing 20 minute sessions, in outdoor natural light</li>
	<li>To keep it running smoothly, please try to be on time or a smidgen early</li>
	<li>You will receive at least 10 edited photos</li>
	<li>Cost will be $75</li>
	<li>She mainly does child/toddler photography but will do a few family photos if Mom &amp; Dad want to hop in a couple</li>
</ul>
Let me know if you have any questions.

Also, this mama is THE busiest person I know and she rarely gets any sleep. I think she has special powers, and we are SO grateful that she is taking her PRECIOUS <del>spare</del> time to help bring our family home!
