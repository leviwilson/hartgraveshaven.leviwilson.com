<h2>We love ya!</h2>
We just love all of you, <strong>so</strong> very much. It's such an encouragement to us as we wait (sometimes impatiently), that you all are waiting and praying right beside us. You all check in with us and send texts/emails to let us know you're praying for our family across the big sea-- warms our hearts!

The best though is seeing our nieces' and nephew's reaction toward adoption. It's hysterical and sweet. Paige thinks she can speak their language (there is a an amazing video, but it has some country-specific things so we're not permitted to actually post, so I will wait until later to share that one!). Libby asks EVERY time they come here if our kids are home yet. Sophee and Braylee are very excited that they will get to have new cousins and are excited to see what they will look like. They've assured us that they will be very nice to their new cousins. The last time Hunter was here he was playing and he randomly stopped and looked up and said "Hey. When you going to get those kids?!" I don't know bud. I wish we knew!
<h2>Current Paperwork Process</h2>
This process is a funny one. We told everyone we were adopting over a year ago; however, we've <em>technically</em> only been waiting for 8.5 months. I know. Our time doesn't start ticking until our paperwork is accepted in-country. The wait can be overwhelming, but we try really really hard to just enjoy it being the two of us and our furry dog...that I almost stepped on this morning. It was a traumatic morning for Ruby.

We started the paperwork process in December of 2014 and had a completed homestudy by Spring. They expire after a year so we had to do another homestudy update. Naturally, I was worried about it. I asked some of our other adoption family friends about their updates and they assured me it was no big deal. I was still nervous, but I didn't spend as much time cleaning the house this time around as I had previously. Our first homestudy took about 4 hours. This one was much shorter and much less intimidating. We only had to spend time going over the things that had changed, which was basically just our last year's tax info. Since nothing had changed on our adoption paperwork (we're still on paper set to adopt 2 children, up to the age of 5) the rest was easy.

They did a quick walkthrough of the house. Its funny because a question they have to ask is where the children are going to sleep and they must see the rooms to ensure that they are a decent-sized room large enough for a child. We have plenty of extra space, but the funny part is telling them which rooms will be our kids' rooms. We really have no idea who they are yet. Do they share a room now? Will they want to share a room when they get here? Are they close in age? Are they the same gender? Plus we don't know what ages they are. 1 year - 5 years is quite the range. Are they in a crib, a toddler bed or a big kid bed? Of course we'll have plenty of time to prepare for that between trips 1 and 2.

We just received our approved updated homestudy, and we sent it off to USCICS for an update there. That one is only good for 1 year as well. Soon we'll get appointments times sent to us to get fingerprinted (again), and then we'll send those off hopefully for a quick approval. Then... we wait.
<h2>Our "ask"</h2>
Here is our ask. Will you please join us in praying that we will not have to do another update? We're <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>praying</strong></em></span> we get our referral before another year occurs and we have to update again. Of course there will be a ton of paperwork once we get our referral, we're just praying this is our last update without knowing who our children are.

In addition to that, please pray that our children are bonding with a special caretaker and are thriving in their environment. This will likely help the transition into being in a family go more smoothly once they are here.

We're just continuously praying that our children are happy, healthy, being loved and that their physical and emotional needs are met......and that our referral comes very soon! We're excited and dream about the day we get "the call." We think of them often. What we'd be doing as a family if they were here. I look daily at the temperature in their capitol city and I think "It's warm and sunny today! I hope they are playing outside!" or "It's nighttime there now... sleep well my sweet babes!" When our children are here I will be sure they know how much they were prayed for and loved, LONG before we even knew who they were.

Thanks again for the prayers and support! You all are the best!
