<span style="line-height: 1.5em;">I believe that there are special "God Moments" that fill our day. I also believe that we sadly often skim over them without noticing much. This post however, is about a big yea God moment that happened to us...</span>

For the last few weeks Tom and I have been updating some of our adoption paperwork. We went back and forth at the beginning of our process about whether we wanted to put on our paperwork 1 or 2 children or to just leave it at two. We had initially decided on 1 OR 2; however, after a few months we both felt in our hearts that we wanted to change that paperwork to just say two children. A simple change in adoption paperwork is rarely simple. It requires refilling out multiple forms, getting them notarized, apostilled and also getting approval from the USCIS.  We've been in the process of doing that the past few weeks when a sibling group of 3 was brought to our attention.

Yikes.

We began to pray about and think about yet another hard decision for our family. It turned out that that original sibling group of 3 wasn't going to work out; however we started thinking. If we were open to that sibling group of 3, instead of just putting on our paperwork 2, should we put 2 OR 3?

Were we crazy? Were we up for this? How hard could 3 really be? (I know, all you parents out there are laughing at me as you read this!). Two OR two to three. What should it be? Oy.

Tom and I were talking and going back and forth, back and forth. One of the biggest things we did not want to do was to act in our own human nature. There were often times when dealing with infertility that if we would have really stopped to listen to what He wanted for us, perhaps we would have went down a certain path a lot sooner. Who knows, but what we did know was that we were going to do our best to listen to what He wanted for our family this time around. But what was that?

Tom and I were talking to each other and our friends/family about how do you know when it's what He wants and not what you want. I've said this out loud multiple times, but I often wonder why He can't just come to us in dream to tell us answers.

Sometimes He does. Sometimes he literally puts the answer right in front of your face.

Tom and I were grabbing dinner out last Thursday and on the way home we decided to randomly go out of our way turn right to check out something when to get to our house we would have normally turned left. Right when we turned right, Tom said, "Look at that..."

In shock, I clumsily fumbled for my phone to take a photo of this license plate:

[caption id="attachment_478" align="alignnone" width="538"]<a href="http://hartgraveshaven.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/IMG_2466.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-478 " alt="Adoption" src="http://hartgraveshaven.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/IMG_2466-e1415144378322-768x1024.jpg" width="538" height="717" /></a> Okay, God. We get it. Two it is.[/caption]

I was speechless for about the second time in my life, and all I could do was giggle. It made my <del>week</del> year. An answered prayer that was literally spelled out for us.

It was such a good moment. We actually (in a non-stalker way) stopped to chat with the vehicle when they got gas across the street from where we were headed. We told the woman our dilemma and now answered prayer and she just laughed. She too had adopted two children.

I just grin so big when I think about it. God knows who our children are. He knows the two children that will soon join our family, and He knows that we should put "2" on our paperwork. Adoption isn't always the easiest nor is it the most fun process... I assure you the wait is really not that fun at all. We will treasure this "Yea God Moment" in our wait and will put it in our kids' Life Book and tell them about it. How God picked them specifically for us. Before we even saw a photo of them or knew their given names, He knew they were meant to be a Hartgraves. We'll remind them of that when they hate us for not letting them watch TV before homework is done, and when they can't go anywhere until they clean their room. I'm sure they'll <em>love</em> hearing this story in those moments. <em>wink. </em>

Thanks for stopping in! And again, thanks for your prayers. God surely answers them. Speaking of answered ones, I put on here a few times to pray for my friend Lauren and her husband who were adopting. Well, they got their referral. THREE TODDLER BOYS from South Africa! They'll be traveling in the next few months to meet them and bring them home. South Africa is different than Europe (if you're thinking geographically, duh. I know!) in that they only make one trip; however that one trip is 6-8 weeks long. So just be praying for their extra long visit to South Africa as they get their kiddos!

We love ya'll!
