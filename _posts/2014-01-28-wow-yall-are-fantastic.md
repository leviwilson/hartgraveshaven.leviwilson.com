We sent some adoption letters out to some friends and family early last week, and announced our adoption decision on Facebook yesterday. I have to tell you - I was SO NERVOUS. I knew we'd get a lot of support, but I had also heard from many people who have gone before us in this process that we will run into some people who aren't supportive about our decision. Now, either you anti-adoption people are keeping quiet for now, or we have the best family and friends. Ever. I'm going to go with the latter!

We have been so overwhelmed this week with the love that you all once again have drenched us in. We have gotten texts, calls and emails all week long. We have heard "About time! We were wondering when you were going to adopt!" and "I don't know how I'm going to help yet, but I'm helping!" Many of you have had an emotional reaction to reading about our Jacob and how we came to our decision to adopt. I assure you, it's been an emotional journey for us as well.<em> </em>Other's have already come to us and said "I'm putting together a fundraiser for you!" and "When the weather is nice, I'm doing a mini-photo session fundraiser for you." People have offered to donate their commission to a party (like thirty-one and Trades of Hope). Seriously people? We are blown away by your generosity.

<em></em>Also, we can't believe it but our <a href="https://www.adopttogether.org/hartgraveshaven">AdoptTogether.org</a> account immediately had donations made to it, as well as some people sending donations directly to us. If they developed a new word for being extra overwhelmed, that would be us. Wow. Minds Blown! <del>Our</del> Tom's main hold up has been the cost (I don't typically worry about money much, I feel like I live with Dave Ramsey Jr.!). Adoption is so expensive but Tom and I have said, "Lord, if you want us to do this—we are all in. We trust you will bless us with the means to do it." Don't you love it when God says, "See? I told you so!"<em> (well, in this particular case "I told you so" is nice...sometimes it's not always the best! ha)</em>

Tom and I aren't usually people that accept/seek help or assistance. I spent a good portion of this summer flat on my back on strict bed rest, not able to get up much. During this time, I heard some scolding from many of you that sounded like this: "People want to help. You <em>have</em> to let them because it blesses them to help you." That was SO hard for us! Finally I got to the point where I'd call our friends, The Pliquett's,  up and say "Hey Laura, when are you bringing my dinner?! I'm hungry!" JUST KIDDING! I was never that bad. But Tom did tell them to buy 'to go' containers because he didn't want to have to do too many dishes haha. What I'm saying is, it's hard for us but we're learning to let people help so that this process doesn't become overwhelming in a bad way, but overwhelming in a sense that we are so grateful to you all for helping our growing family.

I have to tell you, that when we lost our son Jacob this summer I would walk around in public wondering if I was "That Girl"... you know, the one with the really sad story? I was 100% sure that when I was in the grocery store or some place public, people could see the "tragic" stamp that was across my forehead <em>(no, I don't have the other kind that is tattooed on my lower-back!). </em>I  was sure people would know that something terrible had happened. I just felt different and thought people could tell. It was a weird feeling; however, even then I knew our story wasn't finished. I knew it wasn't going to end there and there was something more. It took us awhile to turn our ears to God and actually listen, but when we did I was filled with such positive thoughts. Now I'm "That Girl" in the grocery store. The one that's on an amazing journey. One of faith and hope. Again, our journey isn't nearly complete, but it's an exciting path to be on, especially with a little help from our friends!

I spent most of yesterday fighting back tears. I assure you, I am not an emotional person but this process is an emotional one. I was just in complete shock at how generous and supportive everyone was being. I told Tom that it was such a good week, and that I expected people to be happy - but what we got went beyond just 'happy' for us.

Again, we are so grateful to you all for your support. Seriously. I was kind of nervous sending out the letters because I just wasn't sure what kind of feedback we would get. I underestimated you all, sorry about that. I should have known better. Ya'll are awesome!

Now that I've said "overwhelmed," "grateful" and "generous" way too many times, I should let you go. Next time I'll break out the thesaurus.
