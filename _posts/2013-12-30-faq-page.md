[et_pb_toggle title="What are Photoshop Files?"]
Elegant Themes offers two different packages: Personal and Developer. The Personal Subscription is ideal for the average user while the Developers License is meant for experienced designers who wish to customize their themes using the original Photoshop files. Photoshop files are the original design files that were used to create the theme. They can be opened using Adobe Photoshop and edited, and prove very useful for customers wishing to change their theme's design in some way.

[et_pb_toggle title="Can I upgrade after signing up?"]

[et_pb_toggle title="Can I use your themes with WP.com?"]
Unfortunately WordPress.com does not allow the use of custom themes. If you would like to use a custom theme of any kind, you will need to purchase your own hosting account and install the free software from WordPress.org. If you are looking for great WordPress hosting, we recommend giving HostGator a try.[/et_pb_toggle]
