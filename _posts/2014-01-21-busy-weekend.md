This weekend was so packed full...I was actually looking forward to going into work just to get a break! I have a feeling many of our "relaxing" weekends coming up will be like the one we just had. Bring it!

Saturday we had scheduled our first of two visits to complete our home study. This first one was at our house...and I was nervous. I was nervous that Ruby (dog) would jump all over them and have us fail our home study. I also get really awkward (shocking, I know!) when I have to speak about important things and I'm in the hot seat. Well, we were in the hot seat for FOUR HOURS...  it actually wasn't so bad. But I'll get to that in a second.

<del>Thomas and</del> I had a lot of preparations to make before the home visit. I had planned on cleaning a little bit every day of the week that way I wouldn't be overwhelmed on Friday. Well, that's always a good thought but it never happens. I cleaned my face off on Friday. I cleaned all night long!

We also had to have a fire extinguisher on every level of the house. Lets take a poll. Who has a fire extinguisher on every level of the house? ---------------------------------- yeah. I thought so. Nobody does. So it was off to Lowes on Friday to get three of them.

After I cleaned most of the night (Tom was working, but he did clean off his desk) I zonked out and woke up early so that I could mop the kitchen floor one more time (the doodle gets it so messy in the winter!). I got ready as Tom went out and cleared the driveway and sidewalks. Another poll: Who is sick of snow? Yep. Me too. Then we waited.... and the  door bell rang.

And. The. Dog. Went. Crazy! If you've been to our house, you know Ruby is nuts at first, but usually calms down within like 10 minutes, <em>especially</em> when I have prepared her favorite: a frozen kong stuffed with peanut butter. Yeah, go figure it was the first time ever that it didn't work! She went a little nuts for like an hour. But we were highly on edge, so she probably wasn't as crazy as we made her out to be...

But the girls that came to do our visit were super nice and friendly, so once we got going it was easy to just converse and tell them about ourselves and our family.... and our upbringing, finances, parenting styles, goals in life, goals for our children, about the guardians we've chosen, life insurance, we talked about our story to adoption, why we want to adopt.... You name it. Basically everything that happened to us from  0-30 (or 36 in 'ol Tommy Boy's case!). It wasn't too bad though. Then we did a quick run through of our house and they were on their way.  We also  scheduled our office visit with them for this morning (Monday).

Even though I baked some muffins for breakfast (wanted the house to smell good and homey, I'm sly like that!) we were starving by the time it was over. We grabbed a bite, went to church and then we were exhausted and needed some giggles. We know we can find that at our nieces house, so after church we were off to play with legos!

Sunday we slept in and then ran errands. We had a lot of prep to do for our Adoption Announcement Letters that many of you received in the mail. We've been working on those for a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">long</span> time! We finally got them printed (Hindsight: I probably shouldn't have done a gray paper.... argh) and it was time to stuff the envelopes. This is how Tom helped me fold them:

<span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Tom <em>did</em> sign most of them. His penmanship is a lot better than mine... If your letter looks like a first grader signed it, then you were lucky enough to receive mine. We finally got to this point:</span>

And we went to the post office because we couldn't wait another day to share our news! And then we realized it was Martin Luther King Day on Monday and we would have to wait another day. Boo. But way to go MLK!

This morning was our last meeting for our Home Study. This one was quick. Only 40 minutes long. We talked about our neighborhood and neighbors (<em>Hi Stephanie!</em>) and then had to go over our family tree. Then we were done. Whew.

Next up: It's going to take them about a week or so to put the home study together based on the mountain of paperwork and answers we gave them. From there we will go over it and sign off on it. Then we pay our agency our next fee and then it's onto another paper chase called the Dossier, as well as our USCIS check/approval (United States Citizenship and Immigration Services). I hear the USCIS is pretty stressful... actually I hear this whole entire process is pretty stressful and "not for the faint at heart." Pray for us!
