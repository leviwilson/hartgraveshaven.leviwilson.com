Hello friends! I haven't written much on here lately because lately, there isn't much to report. A lot of this adoption process is going to be a "hurry and wait" effort. Which we're fine with (so far). Tom and I have the waiting game down to a science and we try to keep ourselves busy and entertained between things. <em>Sidenote: This photo has absolutely nothing to do with this post, but isn't Indy a beaut!</em>

Anyhow, we're at the USCIS stage at the moment. The way that works is we send in our initial packet of stuff and then they mail us a letter telling us they got our letter. Then in 3-4 weeks after that they mail you a letter with an appointment time to go to an immigration office to get fingerprinted. We weren't expecting our letter or appointment time for another couple of weeks but it actually arrived last weekend! We've been told that while they aren't always friendly about it,  if you have an appointment time set they'll let you go earlier. However, our appointment is actually set for next Thursday and this week has been too busy to go so I think at this point we're just going to follow the rules (shocker, I'm a geeky rule follower!) and we'll just go when the appointment is set. I'll be sure to come back with a "Tales of the USCIS" post; however, I'm guessing it will likely not be über exciting. After we get fingerprinted we send that back to them and then we all join hands and pray and pray and pray that they don't request anymore information or have any hiccups in the process.<em> I would make an awesome joke about a non-existent criminal record but like I said, I'm terrified and I feel like they're reading this and watching us. So I'm going to bite my tongue on that one.</em>

Due to the fact that our USCIS letter came early, and we've heard rumors of USCIS currently operating on shorter wait times, we are full-throttle on gathering items for our dossier. Which means this weekend I have to "stage" the house and take photos of the exterior of our house and all of the interior rooms. I'm thinking getting a professional to come for the photographs along with having fresh floral arrangements around the house. Tom is thinking "Just clean it and use your point-and-shoot." I'm fairly certain his idea will win out, but maybe I can sneak in a flower or two. We also are gathering family photos of ourselves and our extended family among a whole lot of other information. I can handle paperwork, but adoption paperwork can easily get my stomach all twisted. It's like each little mark you put actually effects something of substance, like say... our family.

In reality I know that God has already hand-picked our child(ren)... but nerves tend to creep in often.

Please keep up the prayers for us that this process goes swiftly and smoothly and that our child(ren) are being loved and well taken care of.

Also, our amazing family is planning a fundraiser that is currently scheduled for May 3 at KLMC. More details to come on that, but it will be a dinner AND a silent auction... and we have some <em>incredible</em> items for you to bid on! We'll also be selling some T-shirts (that I think are slammin' but I'm biased because I designed them). I'll be taking pre-orders on those hopefully this next week, but I need to verify pricing costs first. There is a fun story behind the T-shirts that I'll share with you too! Get. Excited! Anyhow, more details coming later on that event but it should be a great time. Keep your schedules opened that evening!

XOXO
