Nothing much on the adoption front. I believe that's pretty much how the story goes with this sort of thing. We've been told it's a lot of "hurry up and wait" type of stuff, and so far that is fairly accurate. Last week we got fingerprinted for with the USCIS. We're hoping to have our approval back in about a month. I'm not 100% sure but we might get assigned an immigration officer to us and they may request more information. We're hoping they have everything they could possibly need (we sent a little more than was even requested) because if they request more info it Â will delay us a bit because we'll have to get the said info, mail it out, wait for them to look at it and wait for them to either approve us or request even more. We're pretty boring people so I can't imagine there is much more they'll want to know-- we pretty much told them everything literally from birth to present.

Anyhow, while they're doing that, we've been gathering our dossier documents. We are very nearly done with that as well. We just have to get them notarized. You know what's awesome? Having a notary that lives across the street! We love our neighbors (thanks Stephanie and Josh!) It saves us a lot of time, and Josh has graciously agreed to notarize our dossier for us. After that, we'll take it to the secretary of state to get apostilled (which is basically a stamp that certifies the notary).

I thought the dossier was going to be a lot harder than it is. I'm hoping this next statement remains accurate, but I thought the home study has been the hardest part of this whole process. It required a lot more attention, detail and work.... not to mention a lengthy personal interview. So far the dossier hasn't been too difficult. Hoping it remains that way - USCIS has the power to make it harder but praying it remains smooth!

Part of the dossier paperwork required us to submit a couple dozen photos of our home and extended family. We've been told that they sometimes try to match the child(ren) with people they think the children look like. No pressure on the photos or anything. Luckily Emily Miller shot some of us so we were set, and we tossed in a couple wedding ones as well.

This photo is mid-assembly when I was putting the photos and printed labels into the protectors. They said that sometimes people just submit an envelope and write on the back, but if you've ever received anything hand-written from me, you would know that I write like a child. They'd be like "Awe... they had their niece write on the back..." Kind of like that Friends episode where Joey wrote the reference letter and sent it directly to the agency and the agency loved it because they thought a child did it? That was a good one!

We had to include exterior photos of our home, the yard, and of each room in the house. As well as extended family (I mentioned that earlier <em>p.s. Thanks Amanda Harris for getting a recent shot of my sisters family!)</em>. I also ran around to our subdivision's park and shot the playground and the basketball/tennis courts.

The interior of the house was difficult. It took me hours because I would clean, and then we have clutter kind of sitting there. It's well-placed clutter, but I didn't want it in the shot. So I basically moved clutter from one room to the other all day long taking photos. I also may or may not have removed an ugly USA-inspired border from one of the guest rooms in Photoshop. I mean, it's going to be coming down anyways.... I just didn't want Europe to think we were USA-crazed lunatics.... The previous owners put it up for whatever reason and we just haven't gotten to that room yet. It was some pretty handy photoshop work if I do say so myself. I was quite proud because I'm not that good with photoshop.

Yes. Even Ruby's toys were shifted from room to room.

Speaking of Ruby... She's our family too. So I tried to get a good shot of her. She fits well in this family because we're not photogenic either. This is her best work:

Needless to say, I used old photos I had on my phone of Ruby because these weren't really going to work....

That's about it. I imagine most posts will be boring because there isn't much news. Please be praying that our USCIS moves along and we get approved without any hiccups.

ALSO. If you haven't pre-ordered a <a title="T-shirts" href="http://hartgraveshaven.com/?page_id=242">T-shirt</a> yet and you want one, please be sure to do so. I'm cutting the pre-orders off at the end of the month so we can get shirts in time for our <a title="Dinner + Silent Auction" href="http://hartgraveshaven.com/?page_id=256">May 3 </a>event. We will be ordering a few extra, but I can't really guarantee you one unless you pre-order.

Thanks! XO
