Thank you so much for your prayers! We are officially approved by the USCIS to adopt 1 or 2 children from our beautiful European country! This approval came pretty swiftly and we are thankful and know that was due to your prayers! We were assigned a USCIS officer and I had to call her up a couple of times. Thank goodness she is like the nicest thing! And it's crazy, you'd think calling a government office would be more like calling AT&amp;T or something, where you have to hit a million buttons and talk to a robot and then 3 hours later you're disconnected and have to start again. Not here. The USCIS is a well-oiled machine! You call and you actually get to speak with someone, you tell them your officer's name and/or office number and they put you through, and guess what - They actually answer! Once time she didn't answer but I left a voicemail and she called back like 30 minutes later. I don't even answer voicemails 30 minutes later. It was unreal. Once we get our referral, we will have to go through the USCIS again and we will work with the same officer, which is great.

<em>A side note: Do you know how hard it is to not say the name of the country on here? I say it constantly all day long every day, and then I type here and I find myself doing a Command + F (find) to search for the country to ensure I haven't accidentally slipped and spelled it out! </em>
<h2>So what now?</h2>
As I type this, Tom is on his way downtown to pick up our dossier from <a href="http://www.mljadoptions.com/">MLJ</a>. I dropped it off last week to have them go over it to make sure everything was good. She said it was all good and "very well put together and tidy" That's right. My photo labels must have done the trick ;) So Tom is picking it up to take it to the state department to get all of the documents apostilled (which basically certifies the notary).

Once that is all set, there is one minor legal paper our agency has to get translated (to be honest I don't know what this really is but we don't have to do anything for it I don't think) and THEN we can send out dossier in-country! After they receive our dossier in Europe, it will be translated and then sent to the Ministry of Justice (MOJ). Our countdown begins about 8 weeks after we first send the documents. It takes about a month to translate and about a month with the MOJ to look over before we're "officially" on the list. Unfortunately we're not notified when we are officially on the list, we're only notified if something is missing/wrong in our paperwork... so hopefully we don't get notified :)

We also have another payment due when we submit our dossier in-country that has to be sent in Euros. After we pay this payment, we'll be about half way there for finances. We won't owe anything else until we get our referral. Thank you to all who have helped in our efforts!
<h2>Who is the MOJ?</h2>
The Ministry of Justice is one of the most important people in our eyes! You will hear us say MOJ a lot, so get familiar. They actually read over our documents and match us with our child(ren) based on what we put in our dossier. No pressure on the dossier or anything. Geesh! One of the more stressful parts of the dossier was filling out the MOJ application. It wasn't just a standard factual form... you had to write on it! Like "In one paragraph, present your family" Uhhhhhhh. -------------------- yeah. I drew blanks. We also had to write about our hopes/dreams for our child(ren). It was difficult but I'm happy with our answers. It was just terrifying because the person who reads that also matches us so it was high-pressure. Glad it's done!
<h2>What do we do after we're on the list?</h2>
By the time we're on the list, half of our funds will have been paid. We have until we get our referral to save/raise the rest. So.... I personally will be taking on as much freelance work as I can handle without drowning. I'm working full-time plus I have anywhere from 5-15+ hours of freelance work a week. I'm staying pretty busy. Tom is also working a lot of overtime; however, Tom always has worked a lot over overtime so that hasn't really changed.

Also, we have to complete adoption education courses. We've actually done most of them but there are a few more we have to do. Some of the required classes have been absolutely fantastic. We have a class tonight called "From Infertility to Adoption." I gotta tell ya, I'm not so much looking forward to that one! I will get into it in more detail later, but there are many ways in which we will have to parent differently - especially when we initially bring our family home. The classes also prepare us for some of the questions we will get from the public, some of which will surely be offensive... and they teach us to remain calm, but to stand up for our family. I'm a calm, non-confrontational person.... until you mess with my family. I'll be sure to let you know how I do when we get the first ignorant question :) They have said that most of the offensive questions come from people who know you like family and friends... so you guys behave, alright? ;)

We also have to write a report about the country we are adopting from. This is really important because it familiarizes us with our child(ren)'s beautiful culture so that we can celebrate where our family came from with them when he/she/they are here. We've already learned of some Christmas traditions that we will "adopt" in our home and make them part of our holiday traditions as well. They say you can do the report as more of a fun project and not necessarily a written report. I hope to be able to put together some sort of photo book... but I still haven't put together our wedding album so we'll se how that goes. <em>I know. Seriously Ashlie. GET ON IT! </em>

Also, while we wait we will be keeping busy. I'm foreseeing lots of trips to Turkey Run, and (inexpensive) house projects and kayaking on Geist and anything else we can do to keep our minds off of the waiting. I think we'll always need to plan something to look forward to so that we don't JUST focus on the wait.
<h2>What can you do?</h2>
Simply pray. AND attend our event on <a title="Dinner + Silent Auction" href="http://hartgraveshaven.com/?page_id=256">May 3</a>.

We're getting really excited for our dinner + silent auction event. We really can't wait to see you all and to just celebrate our journey with you. We really have no idea what to expect and I'm getting kind of nervous, yet excited all at the same time. There are a TON of awesome items to bid on for the silent auction. And just to reiterate, we'll have the capability to take card payments as well as cash or check and trust me, you'll want to bid on some of them. The community and beyond has really opened up and embraced our family and we are just over-the-moon excited for the day do arrive!

Hope to see you soon!

xoxo
