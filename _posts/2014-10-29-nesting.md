We often get asked how the process is going and if we've heard any news... No news, but thank you for asking! It makes us feel good that people are still thinking of us and praying for us. We just hope you don't get sick of the same answer: "Yep... still waiting..."

The adoption timeline can be an annoying one because you don't know when it ends. When you're pregnant, you know that your ETA is 9 months (most of the time). In adoption, you're still awaiting the arrival of your bundle(s) of joy with great anticipation and excitement, except you have no idea how long you will be waiting. I'm kind of a "need to know now" person. When we were pregnant with Jacob, I didn't debate for a second finding out the gender. I had to know ASAP so we could prepare things for him specifically. So the adoption timeline without an end date is <del>a little bit</del> frustrating.

With that being said, we started the paperwork process in December of last year. So basically we're 11 months paper-pregnant (even though we've only really been on "the list" for four months). So we'll say four months paper-pregnant. Technically.

When You've been preparing to adopt for nearly a year, you're definitely getting into that nesting zone. When I first heard the term "paper pregnant" I thought, "oh, that's clever and cute." But now, I totally get it. Adoption is funny in that you really do feel pregnant (on paper) with a child but you have no idea who, or when. We still go through some of the same thoughts/emotions as a biologically expecting family would.

We have the urge to nest like nobody's business. It's frustrating though because we can't really buy anything because we don't know what age, what gender or what size. We can't set up a bedroom(s) for the same reasons. Will they rather share a room? We don't know. When people say they have gently used items for us if we want them, we can't really take it because we don't know what we need to stock up for. I've been browsing baby name apps and  jotting down a few I like- much like a biologically expecting family would.

When you're pregnant, you are also usually studying up and reading "What to expect when you're expecting" and books on how to actually raise a human. So, being paper-pregnant, we're reading books on how to be really rad adoptive parents. We're talking to other adoptive families on their experiences. We're just learning. Learning, decluttering and waiting. <em>P.S. I will have more info to share with you on things we've learned from our adoption classes and books. There will be important things for friends and family to take note of.  Just an FYI :) </em>

We're also trying to do more and plan more. I told Tom that we should plan one thing a month that we can look forward to, to help pass the time. We haven't done anything major, but have planned little things along the way and have stayed busier than usual so help the time pass quickly.

So in the meantime, we're just "nesting" in terms of our actual nest that we can control. We've also been on a mission to declutter the house now. While we have the time. We started with photos. Actually, let me clarify. Tom started by organizing photos and I felt guilty for just laying on the couch watching him, so I then jumped in. Next on my list is to take down the ugly flag border in one of our guest rooms. I'm not saying our flag is ugly, because it's not. I'm saying that a million flags in one room is a <em>little</em> excessive.

This is what Ruby thinks of the waiting, and I'd say we agree. Poor girl has no idea. At some point in the (hopefully) near future, she's going to have some little kids pulling on her ears and fur. Luckily Ruby has been around small ones her whole life and she's used to a little child-roughness (thank you for that, Paige) ;)
