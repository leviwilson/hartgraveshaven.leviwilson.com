WARNING: I'm about to seriously ramble.

I was going to make a video so that I could clearly express how grateful we are to all of you. However, my computer camera adds 50 pounds ;) and I'm one of those "ugly criers" so in lieu of a video, you're getting a <del>little</del> long write up.

On May 3, we had a dinner + silent auction to help raise money for our adoption funds. My cousin Jessica headed up the planning of it, which was great for us because 1) we don't live in-town anymore and it'd be hard to do all of that from a distance and 2) well, it's a whole lot easier when someone has done this sort of thing before; we wouldn't have had a clue how to go about something of this caliber. Tom and I did everything we could from a distance and there were lots of texts and planning phone calls that increased in frequency as the event got closer; however, we didn't really have too much on <em>our</em> to do lists.

A lot of planning went into this thing. There were tons of people to call on for the silent auction, there was a dinner planning/purchasing for roughly 300 people. There were little things like tickets, bid sheets and signs that needed to be made. As the event got closer, nobody knew what to expect. At one point, Jessica asked if we wanted to put an ad for the event in the paper. She was concerned about filling the room, I was nervous of having to turn people away. I  said, "Jessica, God has put adoption on our hearts and has brought us down this path, He will give us the means to do it and fill the church for the dinner with the perfect amount. I'm sure of it." We both agreed and decided not to put an ad in the paper. As the event got closer, we both got worried that the event would be bring in too many people and we might run out of food. That's when my cousin Tara &amp; Vanessa started joking about how being at a church would be a good place to run out of food; afterall, Jesus did feed thousands with just a small amount of bread and fish!

The Sunday before the event, my Grandmother passed away. She was so ready to go. She wasn't really 'Gram' any more as her dementia had become too severe. She knew people were familiar but didn't fully know who they were. It broke my heart to see her that way because my Grandma and I have always had a special relationship; so I was relieved when I learned of her passing. In Christ, she now has a competent brain and a body without pain or suffering. We sure will miss her dearly. Before she passed I told her that Tom and I had a cute little boy  named Jacob that she had to hold and love when she got to Heaven. She told me "Oh. Okay. I will." I also told her of our adoption plans and I told her to tell The Man Upstairs to protect our family and help speed this process up. She agreed to tell Him. I said I loved her and headed back to Indy. She passed a few days later. We laid Grandma to rest on Friday May 2. It was a lovely service and it was good to hear stories about her and Grandpa that I never knew before; like the time their broken down RV held up traffic in the little town of Walkerton just as they were heading out for a trip. I'm sure Grandpa was <em>so ticked!</em>

After the funeral, we had a bit more setting up to do for the fundraiser, so a bunch of family came to help set up in the evening so that Saturday we could relax a bit before chaos hit.

&nbsp;

<span style="line-height: 1.5em;">We woke up Saturday with equal parts of excitement and nerves. It's so weird that almost exactly a year ago Tom and I were in a very scary place, not knowing what the outcome of our pregnancy would be and trying to be faithful and calm. Now, a year later we are filled with so much hope and excitement for what God has in store for our little family.</span>

My mom said, "What are you doing?!" I said "A selfie, duh."[/caption]

We went to the church early to finish up doing some last minute things and then it was show time. We were so overwhelmed! You generous people just flooded in those doors to support us and our family. I was on the verge of joyful tears most of the night. My husband however, was near the cotton candy most of the night ;) I saw and spoke to many of you that I had not seen in years. I heard stories of other families and their adoptions. People spoke to us about losing our son and how you have been praying for Tom and me- we were so touched and grateful for all of the support and prayers. I heard "keep the change" quite a bit. We saw old friends from high school that we hadn't seen in forever. I tell you, we were so happy! It was so fun to see months of Jessica's hard work and planning come together, to help us bring our family home. Some of you I saw out of the corner of my eye then wasn't able to see you again before the event was over. So sorry we missed speaking with you! It felt like our wedding day actually. Trying to get around to talk to every single person there and thank them for coming, but failing miserably because there were just so many people and exciting things happening.

Thanks brother![/caption]

&nbsp;

We kept getting asked  if we had any thoughts on how much we would raise. I thought at a minimum we would raise (between t-shirts, dinner and silent auction)  around $3,000 and I was thinking $5,000 on the high end (because I knew the auction retail value was over $5,o00).  At the end of the night, we started cleaning up and also started getting a rough tally of the funds. When my brother told us the rough initial count, we couldn't believe it. I just hugged my husband and started crying, and we ran to find Jessica to tell her the news.

<span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Sorry to keep you in suspense, but hold of just a little longer. Tom and I have already paid a very large portion of our initial adoption fees that have got us to the point of submitting our dossier. Tom and I had discussed that if we could raise in the course of a YEAR $10,000 that would be incredibly helpful, as that would cover  <em>most</em> of the remaining costs of our adoption fees at the time of our referral (however, if we are referred a sibling group, that cost will go up slightly). In addition to the agency fees remaining, we will still have to pay for our travel expenses. </span>

<strong>You guys ready? We had hoped to raise $10,000 in the course of a year. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">God did that in ONE DAY</span>. </strong>

We couldn't believe it. It's funny because we feel God nudged us toward adoption (or maybe it was more than a nudge, maybe it was a body slam into it, but either way— we got the point and said "yes, Lord.") But we're human, and sometimes you second guess yourself and need reassurance that you're doing what God wants you to. This was certainly some reassurance...and  also a big fat reminder to not limit our limitless God. I mean I expected $3,000. He provided more than 3x that!

In the meantime, our family is in Europe and they have no idea who we are and we don't know who he/she/they are. We love our child(ren) dearly, and we think about them constantly. Both of our phones are set so we can easily see what time it is where our family is at, as well as what kind of weather they're experiencing. We wonder if they're playing outside, or if they're just learning to crawl or walk or who their little sweet selves are and what their giggle sounds like.

Thank you.

From the bottom of our being, we thank you. You have impacted our lives greatly and have helped us get to the point where if a referral came tomorrow, we would be prepared. It's amazing. God is so good. That little town in Northern Indiana is the most generous community of family and Godly people. It packs a punch I tell you, small towns do big things. BIG things. This adoption, it's bigger than us it's scary to think about everything that will go into play and people who read our paperwork and look at our photos and match us with our Family - it's crazy. But God has it. He knows who our family is that is waiting for us over there. He knows. He used you all as a vessel to help us bring them home. The Bible says:
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><em>Pure and genuine religion in the sight of God the Father means caring for orphans and widows in their distress and refusing to let the world corrupt you. -James 1:27</em></p>
Not everyone is called to adopt a child; however we can all help in some way. Whether it's sponsoring a family overseas, praying for children in orphanages or buying chicken and noodles and outbidding someone at a fundraiser to help two people who have struggled, become parents.

Thank you for helping us.

I hate this post because it really does not do justice. I jumped on our website this week and I saw that our stats have been elevated and I felt bad because I figured people were popping in for an update to see how the fundraiser went but I was having a ton of trouble putting it into words. This doesn't do it justice. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. We love you and each of you who have prayed for us, bought a t-shirt, ate chicken&amp;noodles, sent an encouraging word or donation or the countless things you all have done - Thank you. THANK YOU. God bless you all.

ALSO, I'd like to take the time to thank a few people who have helped put on such a successful event. I do apologize though, as I am sure I might accidentally forget someone and I assure you I will feel terrible about it once I realize!

<h1>THANK YOU!</h1>
(33x).
