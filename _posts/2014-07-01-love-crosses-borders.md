It's been awhile since I've written in here. Not a whole lot to report. Paperwork is done and now we wait. Then wait some more.

However, we did get a fun little something. We designed &amp; sold some <a title="T-shirts" href="http://hartgraveshaven.mkweddingstory.com/?page_id=242">T-shirts</a> as a fundraiser and my favorite European wanted one as well. For those of you unfortunate people who do not know the dimpled Beata from Poland- I will tell you that she is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">never</span> in Poland. She's always traveling somewhere and in another country. She currently is living in Cambodia for a year-ish maybe more. As you can imagine, mail is a little more sparse in Cambodia than in the good 'ol USofA, so Beata had me send her shirt to her friend in Germany to pick up later, and also ordered one for her friend there. So, somewhere in Germany some lovely people are wearing these t-shirts:

The other day in the mail we received this pretty little note from our friends in Germany! So great that they are sporting our shirts and supporting our adoption. Warms my heart!

Also, it's been on my heart to mention this, and I've tried writing multiple posts about it but I couldn't ever hit publish. I'll try to keep it short and sweet...

June 22 of this year would have been our son Jacob's first birthday. Many of you may wonder why it is that we didn't really talk about losing him at first; and the answer to that is that we simply couldn't. Tom and I dealt with the loss of our son in a healthy, yet private way. At the time, we only had it in us to function enough for ourselves and didn't have the capacity to be strong enough for everyone else. Jacob is very much a part of our family and our adoption journey. After a bit of time and healing, we were able to tell our story.

As June 22 got nearer, I feared it a little more. When the day came, it was actually quite "normal." We love and miss our Jacob every day, so June 22 was really no different. We reflected a little more and paused (coincidentally) at the time of his birth. We had a peaceful day and it turned out to be a shockingly good weekend. We sure do miss him and his cute little face though. Every day.

Tom and I went to church on Saturday night (June 21) and it was a great sermon from guest speaker, Bob Russell. (Actually, this message hits some great life-points that pertain to everyone. If you want to have a listen, <a href="http://www.northviewchurch.us/resources/messages/" target="_blank">click here</a> and then click on "The Purposeful Life"). In his sermon, Mr. Russell touched on a point that I have often said to others, which is: Happiness is a <em>choice</em>.

It's not always easy, but I choose to be happy. I choose to find life's joy. I'm not <em>always</em> bouncing with glee, but I know I'm blessed and I try to focus on that and the hope for the future to get me through some rough patches.

For those of you going through something big, I want to tell you this:

God has a purpose for your life. Move forward. He is with you. Live that life. Live that purpose.

And when it gets hard again (because it will), head over to the B-I-B-L-E and turn to Jeremiah 29:11.

Thanks for reading and catching up! Please continue to pray for our adoption process— more specifically for peace as we wait and that the wait will be a quick one!
