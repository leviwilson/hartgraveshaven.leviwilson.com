Hi again! Two posts in one week, you fella's are lucky!

I listen to a lot of Christian radio— it soothes the soul and helps start a day off well... and it helps with road rage. I wanted to share this song with you all because the lyrics. Man. I'm just really digging them! I relate to them on an extremely personal level.

Here is the song (I put the full lyrics at the bottom of this post incase you were interested):

Last year when we lost our son Jacob, I was in a weird place. My world had just been rocked. I was devastated (understatement). But Tom and I were moving forward the best we could. While we were sad and yes, sometimes angry- we refused to be angry at God. I had no idea what our future looked like. I was terrified we weren't going to have children in our home. Ever. Which meant we'd have to downsize and move into a condo... because apparently that's what you do when you don't have kids.

It has been about 8 months since Jacob passed away. I don't fully get the "why?" part of it, but I'm starting to see glimpses of something big. Something beyond us and our realm of thought. I guess we'll just be around for the ride.

There are so many pieces to this song that I feel like were ripped right from my heart and put on paper. I was going to copy/paste the parts that spoke to me but I literally had the whole thing highlighted, so if you have the time, read the words. The biggest theme of the song though, is this:

<em>Even though I don't know what your plan is,</em>
<em>I know You're making beauty from these ashes.</em>

Wow. That's so my life. That's a lot of lives. I don't know what His plan is for us for sure... but we're sure we're on the right path for it. <em>I know you're making beauty from these ashes.</em> Amazing. I feel like our adoption journey is God, taking our devastation and making it beautiful. To some of you that may sound twisted, it sounded a little twisted when I typed it. I'm not saying losing Jacob was "beautiful." No. It was terrible, awful and that day was honestly the scariest day of my entire life - BUT, I don't think we'd be going down this journey had that not happened. This journey is going to be legen—wait for it—dary. It's going to change Tom and I in ways we hadn't anticipated.

Here are the lyrics incase you want to know:

I can barely stand right now.
Everything is crashing down,
And I wonder where You are.

I try to find the words to pray.
I don't always know what to say,
But You're the one that can hear my heart.

Even though I don't know what your plan is,
I know You're making beauty from these ashes.

I've seen joy and I've seen pain.
On my knees, I call Your name.
Here's my broken hallelujah.

With nothing left to hold onto,
I raise these empty hands to You.
Here's my broken hallelujah.

You know the things that have brought me here.
You know the story of every tear.
‘Cause You've been here from the very start.

Even though I don't know what your plan is,
I know You're making beauty from these ashes.

I've seen joy and I've seen pain.
On my knees, I call Your name.
Here's my broken hallelujah.

With nothing left to hold onto,
I raise these empty hands to You.
Here's my broken hallelujah.

When all is taken away, don't let my heart be changed.
Let me always sing Hallelujah
When I feel afraid, don't let my hope be erased
Let me always sing Hallelujah.
Let me always sing Hallelujah.

I will always sing
I will always sing
Here's my broken hallelujah.
