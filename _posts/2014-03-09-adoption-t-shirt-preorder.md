To help in our fundraising efforts, we whipped up a fun t-shirt design. We have finished taking pre-order shirts and they will be available for payment/pickup at our <a title="Dinner + Silent Auction" href="http://hartgraveshaven.com/?page_id=256">Dinner + Silent Auction</a> Fundraiser on May 3. If you did not get to pre-order a shirt, but still want one, there will be <em>some</em> extra; however, a shirt and a specific size is not guaranteed. Also, if you will not be at the May 3 event, read below to find out where/how to pick yours up.
<h2>Price</h2>
<ul>
	<li><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">$18 for one t-shirt / $30 for two t-shirts</span></li>
	<li><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Children/Youth shirts are $15 a piece</span></li>
</ul>
<h2>Payment &amp; Pickup</h2>
<ul>
	<li><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Pre-ordered shirts will be available at our fundraiser on <a title="Dinner + Silent Auction" href="http://hartgraveshaven.com/?page_id=256">May 3 at KLMC</a> . We will also have some extras to sell at that event incase you see them in-person and decide you must own one because of their obvious awesome factor.</span></li>
	<li><strong>How to pay?</strong> You can pay at the fundraiser by cash, check or card.</li>
	<li><strong>What if I won't be at the fundraiser? </strong>Don't fret. There are more options.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Indy People:</strong> We'll have shirts at our house. You can pay by card, cash or check. Just arrange a pickup with us.</li>
	<li><strong>Northern Indiana People:</strong> My parent's house will be a t-shirt hub spot. Cash or check will be accepted there<em> (I think. I haven't really told them this info yet.)</em></li>
	<li><strong>Fort Wayne Folks:</strong> Henry and Courtney Leach will be your t-shirt stop shop. They will accept cash or check there as well.</li>
	<li><strong>And for the rest of us? </strong> A few of you out-of-towners have made other arrangements with us and I will touch base with you when the shirts come in and get them sent out. Thanks!</li>

<h2>What is the design all about?</h2>
First of all, sorry to all of you who don't call Indiana "home" but we decided to print Indiana on the shirts because sweet home Indiana is where we will be bringing our children home to. The word below "home" is also "home" in our children's native language and it is pronounced "dom." Beata (the coolest European I know so far - that is until our kid(s) are home!) verified the translation for us because initially I had the wrong translation. Stupid Google translate. We also wanted a shirt that didn't scream "FUNDRAISER!" so hopefully we accomplished that.<em> Just an FYI, we can't say the country or language on the web (visit our <a title="FAQ’s" href="http://hartgraveshaven.com/?page_id=63">FAQ's </a>for more explanation); however we can certainly tell you when you pick up your shirts... so at least you know what language you're wearing on your chest! </em>
<h2>Photo Fun!</h2>
Once our children are home and are well adjusted (many blog posts to come on the adjustment/attachment period), we would love to get a big group photo with everyone who helped us bring our kids home... while, of course, wearing our "home" shirts.
<h2>Will we be selling these on our website?</h2>
If we end up having lots of extras, we definitely will; however, we did the pre-orders so that we wouldn't have too many extra. I'll be sure to let you know if they do become available on the web site.
<h2>Didn't get one but really want one?</h2>
If we have enough people <a title="Contact us" href="http://hartgraveshaven.com/?page_id=165">Contact us</a> saying they want one, we might be able to do another order. We cannot order just one, but if we get a larger bulk order we can place another order. Shoot us a message/email/<a title="Contact us" href="http://hartgraveshaven.com/?page_id=165">contact us</a> if you want one and we'll add you to the list. If the list gets long enough, we'll order more.

Thanks again all, for your awesome support!
