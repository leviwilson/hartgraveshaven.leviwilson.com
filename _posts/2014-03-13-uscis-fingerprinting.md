Today we visited Indianapolis' beautiful downtown for our appointment with the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services office for our biometrics appointment (AKA - electronic fingerprints).

Do you know what habit I have when I get nervous? No, it's not biting my nails. I tend to pick at the skin on the ends of my fingers. I know, how gross is that? But I was nervous....and you know what made me more nervous? Knowing that if I picked too much on my finger that the fingerprint wouldn't read right and I'd have to come back and we'd be slowed down.... and that made me even more nervous.

So Tom and I headed downtown to the federal building where pretty much everything "federal" is. We took off our belts, emptied our pockets, went through the detectors, I still beeped and when they did the personal scan thing I beeped at both ankles. They had me lift up my pants because they thought I might be packin' in my boots. So we go up to the 4th floor to find our room, we walked all around the 4th floor and didn't see it. Then we looked at the address on the paper. We were at the wrong building. No joke. ha. Tom and I both just assumed it would be at the federal building because that's where everything like that is. Oh well, we hopped in the car again and went to the right building, we weren't far and we were still early.

We sat in a waiting room filled with people that represented every country in the world (that's an exaggeration, there were like 25 people in there, so about 15 countries represented, we were the only from USA I believe). They called our names and it was like this "Give me your ID and form. Put your stuff down on the chair to the left of me. Then stand to my right side. Relax your hands." So many rules. Anyways, we were in and out in no time. They just do the fingerprints electronically and then they send them off. And luckily, my nervous habit didn't hinder the scan.

We weren't allowed to take any photos or use cell phones in the office (although other people were- I'm a rule follower). So the only photo I snapped to share was of the lovely Indy. We used to live down there and I don't get downtown often but I sure do miss being in the middle of things (although I would not miss that traffic heading back up to the north side!). Parking was a little scarce today because IU was playing downtown.

So anyways, fingerprints #6 or so, isn't the biggest update in the world, but it's another step closer to our child(ren) and the USCIS part is huge step. If you could please pray that the rest of our USCIS approval goes quickly and smoothly we would greatly appreciate it. Personally, I believe I will just be a little on edge until we get officially on the list in Europe. I just want to be on that list. So. Crazy. Bad.

Thanks for the prayers. We love ya'll!
