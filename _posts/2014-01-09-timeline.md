	<li dir="ltr">Below is an up-to-date timeline of our journey to our family. If you wanted a condensed version, it would be this: It took us <strong>3 months and 21 days</strong> to complete our entire home study, get USCIS approval and finalize our dossier.  Considering they give you 6 months from the completion of the home study to do your dossier, I'd say that is not bad at all! Tom is dynamite at paperwork and he is also extremely motivated - so he didn't let me procrastinate much! Now we sit back, pray for our family and wait.</li>

<h3 dir="ltr">September 27, 2013</h3>
<p dir="ltr">This is the weekend we first started discussing adoption.</p>

<h3 dir="ltr">September 30, 2013</h3>
<p dir="ltr">We bought “Adopting without Debt” by Julie Gumm. It's a Dave Ramsey recommended book, and you know how Tom loves him some Ramsey!</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Adopt-Without-Debt-Creative-Adoption/dp/0983539820"><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-94 alignnone" src="http://hartgraveshaven.mkweddingstory.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/url-150x150.jpg" alt="url" width="150" height="150" /></a></p>

<h3 dir="ltr">October &amp; November</h3>
<p dir="ltr">We spent these months researching international adoption.</p>

<h3 dir="ltr">November 23, 2013</h3>
<p dir="ltr">MLJ (our agency) had an open house, and we turned in our agency application and application fee on the spot</p>

<h3 dir="ltr">November 25, 2013</h3>
<p dir="ltr">We were accepted into MLJ’s International Adoption Program</p>

<h3>December 19, 2013</h3>
Filled out official contract and submitted our first big check. Let the paper chase begin!
<h3>January 10, 2014</h3>
We turned our home study binder in to MLJ Adoptions! It took us 22 days to complete (including holidays, which we think is pretty quick).
<h3>February 11, 2014</h3>
Today our home study was officially approved. From the time we signed and started gathering information for our home study binder to the time we had an official approved home study, it was 54 days. Not too shabby!
<h3>February 13, 2014</h3>
We sent our I-800A form in to the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). It arrived via UPS to Texas at 9:20 on  Valentine's Day! Hope they show us some quick love with our application!
<h3>April 1, 2014</h3>
We received our USCIS Approval!
<h3>April 9, 2014</h3>
We turned our dossier into our agency. We will be on "the list" in roughly two months (our dossier has to be translated and reviewed before being on the list). Let the waiting begin.
<h3 dir="ltr">July 11, 2014</h3>
<p dir="ltr">The day we were officially on "the list"</p>

<h3 dir="ltr">June 2, 2015</h3>
<p dir="ltr">We received our referral! It was about a 10.5 month wait.</p>

<h3 dir="ltr">June 27-July 4, 2015</h3>
<p dir="ltr">We were on Trip One to meet our children.</p>

<h3 dir="ltr">June 27-July 4, 2015</h3>
<p dir="ltr">The morning we left for Bulgaria, we were completing our DS260. We were able to bring that with us to our NGO (Vesta) on our first trip. The Monday after we left, they reviewed our paperwork and by that Friday we had Article 5.</p>

<h3 dir="ltr">September 25, 2015</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Court was held on our behalf in Bulgaria. The judge said "DA!" (YES!)</p>

<h3 dir="ltr">October 24, 2015</h3>
<p dir="ltr">We flew out with an extra suitcase to bring our kiddos home!</p>

<h3 dir="ltr">October 30, 2015</h3>
<p dir="ltr">We landed in the good ol' USA! HOME SWEET HOME!</p>
