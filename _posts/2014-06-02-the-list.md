Today is a big day for the Hartgraves Family. As of today, our dossier has been submitted for 8 weeks, which means we are likely now on "The List" in-country! It's not <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the</span> biggest news, but in a slow-moving adoption journeyâ€”we celebrate each milestone... such as this one. I think there are 3 big days in the adoption world; 1) the day you decide to adopt, 2) the day you get your referral and 3) the "gotcha day" so "the list" isn't top 3, but it sure is up there.

What does being on "the list" actually mean? Basically it means that all of that paperwork we have worked so hard on for months has now been sent to Europe, translated to a beautiful language and has been submitted and registered to the Ministry of Justice (MOJ). The MOJ in our country is responsible for pairing families. We're basically on the list to be matched, so our country now knows who we are.

We think.

They don't really submit a certified "you're on the list" notification. Our agency has told us that 6-8 weeks after we submit our dossier, as long as we do not hear anything from them that we are missing something in our paperwork, then we are on the list. This is week 8 and we haven't heard anything. In this case, no news is good news. We're marking June 1, 2014 as day one of waiting.

Are you thinking "Day 1 of waiting? Haven't they already been waiting?" And that would be correct. The international process is a lot of waiting. You wait a lot to get the proper documents. Then you hurry and get everything around and you wait on translations and things. It's not hard, it's just a lot of hurry up and wait type of stuff. It's been a long process, and not just with adoption. Tom and I have been waiting for a long time to become parents. We have one adorable little fella that we weren't able to bring home, and that makes us parents; however we are looking forward to the many tiny European-giggles that will pour out of our home.

How long will we be waiting? Well, we don't have a clue. We're hoping it will be no longer than 14 months; however it could be around 9 months or less or it could be 2 years (yikes!). We don't know. If your'e the praying type (if you're not, come see me ;) ) please pray for a swift process. Its been fairly smooth so far so please pray that that continues to go smoothly and that our wait is minimal. We know God has our perfect family already picked out, and we're familiar with waiting... we just pray it's on the shorter end of the timeline. I want a "soccer mom" sticker already!

While you're saying your prayers, please add a family to the list that we have become friends with through our agency. They're adopting from Europe as well and they travel this week for the 2nd time to bring home their twins (who are absolutely beautiful). Just say prayers for their journey and for the children, give them peace as they travel. I'm sure that's a bit of a terrifying experience for them since an orphanage is all they know. They're great people. I sent a frantic email or two to them while filling out all of our paperwork and they were so nice and helpful!

We're so excited to start our countdown/waiting process. I've added our "day 1" of waiting to my calendar. And it's also time for Ruby's monthly heart worm, flea and tick medicine.

Sorry I went so long between posts. May has been a crazy one for us. I'll try to step up the post frequency a bit.

Also, I've played this song over and over again in the last handful of years. It's kind of my theme song.
