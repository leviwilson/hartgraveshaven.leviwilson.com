Our neighborhood association (don't you just <em>love</em> those?) only allows us to have a garage sale when it is a declared "neighborhood garage sale,"
which happens to be twice a year. The Spring sale is too close to pull together; however we do plan on having a big. fat. garage sale in the fall...which just so happens to be on the weekend of our anniversary, which is <strong>September 19 - September 21. </strong>As you can imagine, that weekend will be quite <del>romantic and</del> chaotic.
<h1>Here's what you should know:</h1>
<ul>
	<li>Garage sale is Friday, September 19 - Sunday, September 21.</li>
	<li>Do you have items that you think might sell well, that you don't want/need any longer and that you'd be willing to donate to our garage sale? If so, let us know! We have an unfinished basement to start collecting items.</li>
	<li>As it gets closer (and especially if you live in the Indy-area) if you could help us spread the word that would be fantastic. I'm sure i'll come up with some sort of graphic you can share on social media to help our efforts... but it's a long ways away so we have time.</li>
</ul>
Another thing you should know, is that I have never put on a garage sale and I don't typically go to garage sales (unless I'm driving by and see a good DIY project). I have no idea what sells well and what prices things should start at. Do you? If so <a title="Contact us" href="http://hartgraveshaven.mkweddingstory.com/?page_id=165">touch base </a>so I can pick your brain.
<h1>Items that sell well:</h1>
Read the above paragraph. I have no idea... but I did Google it and here is what Google said <em>(if you're a garage sale pro and think these are way off, please let me know!)</em>:
<ul>
	<li>Larger, higher-quality items
<ul>
	<li>Furniture</li>
	<li>Lawn Care items</li>
	<li>Home Goods (lighting fixtures, faucets and things of that nature)</li>
	<li>Home Decor</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Child, Baby &amp; Maternity items</li>
	<li>Tools</li>
	<li>DVD's/Books</li>
	<li>I really have no idea...</li>
</ul>
