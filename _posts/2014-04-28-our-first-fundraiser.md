I think it was about 23 minutes after the Miller family received our adoption announcement letter in the mail that I got a text from Emily that said "I'm doing a mini-photosession fundraiser for you guys." Tom and I were blown away at their generosity - considering Emily did just spend an afternoon in the park taking some photos for Tom and I to announce our adoption, which were the same photos we sent to Europe to introduce ourselves in our dossier paperwork. Needless to say, the Millers are pretty<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> big deal</span> to us.

So, earlier this month I met Emily out in a beautiful Noblesville park to "help" her take family photos. I actually thought it started at 5:30, when it really started at 5. And then I had to text Emily because I didn't know which park she was shooting at. I obviously slacked a little on my "assistant duties" because I also talked quite a bit to people I knew... Such a slacker I am! It was such a fun evening though. It was nice to see the Hoeppner Families and the Lawrence family as well. Little Logan was teething so he was a little upset; however I have some stellar "peek-a-boo" skills and was happy to embarrass myself to help Emily get a good photo. Poor Logan, he had the pouty face and crocodile tears going on - broke my heart, but I'm glad the peek-a-boo game worked on him. He sure is a cutie! I also spent a good portion of my time pitching rocks into the river to get a good laugh out of a handsome little dude who just woke up from a nap. I don't know about Emily, but I was exhausted.

All in all, it was such a fun day and we are so thankful that The Millers offered to do that for us! Yesterday evening they stopped by with the boys to visit a little and to drop of a check from the photo event. We are so thankful for them and their friendship and prayers. They are always right there without having to ask and it's great. Last year when I was on bed rest they didn't even say "can I bring you dinner?" it was "I'm bringing you dinner tomorrow night." I would be like "I'll be on the couch...." We just love them.

Thank you so much Emily and Colin. I know you are so busy with being parents, school, work and everything else you have going on. You just let us know when you need a date night (or 10) and I'll get some good practice in watching the boys!
