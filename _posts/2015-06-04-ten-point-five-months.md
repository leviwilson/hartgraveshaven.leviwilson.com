Sometimes you have one of those days.

A day that starts out completely normal. You're at work trying to knock out some projects. Stomach is growling with anticipation for Taco Tuesday with the Northview crew. You're mid-sentence with another random statement, and your cell phone begins to ring. You look down and blurt out, "OH GOD!" As you grab your phone and run out of the office.

And our lives will never be the same.

That's right folks. It was June 2, 2015 at 11:18 a.m. I looked at my phone to see the logo for MLJ Adoptions. On the other line was Lydia, our agency's European director. She only calls for two reasons: 1) You had a scheduled call. 2) It's <strong>THE</strong> call.

We didn't have a scheduled call.

Me:  "Heeeeello???"
Lydia: "Hi Ashlie. How are you today?"
Me: I'm good......?
Lydia: I have some news for you today.
Me: *cue tears and me falling to the floor on my knees* NO! Oh my gosh! I can't believe it!

We Immediately called Tom on a conference call. He was sleeping. So I called again and again to break through his DND on his phone and he answers.

Me: (I'm still crying at this point) Tom! I have Lydia on the phone!
Tom: IS SOMETHING WRONG?
Lydia: (You could hear her smiling through the phone) No. I have some good news for you. We have your referral.

Folks. I'll let you pause for a moment to soak in that goodness.

You good?

Okay. Good. Because I'm still typing with tears in my eyes.

We've been waiting on "the" list for 10.5 months. We have our referral. We are the proud parents of a girl and boy (and one little dude in Heaven ;) ) . We know who our kids are. We know who we have been praying for and crying for. And we are coming for them!

And you wouldn't believe how hilarious God is. That night we were watching wheel of fortune as we often do (we're the worst at actually guessing accurately) and this was the puzzle:

This Just got real." src="http://hartgraveshaven.mkweddingstory.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IMG_3339-1024x768.jpg" width="717" height="538" /></a> Yes. It sure did.[/caption]
<h2>Leading up to "the" call.</h2>
It was really weird because the weekend before we got the call, Tom said "I had a dream about our kids." I could tell from the way he said it that the dream seemed very real. He said he couldn't remember much but he felt like something big was about to happen. I actually had that same feeling. I didn't know what it was. But I just had this feeling. I felt that it had to be soon.

The night before we got the call, I wrote a weekly verse on our mirror. You know, with Crayola window markers. What? Thirty-somethings don't have window crayons from Crayola? What's funny is, I've never wrote a weeklly verse. This is our first weekly verse on a mirror in our house:

<blockquote><em>Be anxious for nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God; and the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus. -Philippians 4:6-7</em></blockquote>
Also, our master bathroom could use a little decorating. And my handwriting could use a little work. I would have wrote nicer if I knew I was going to have to share the photo.
<h2>Now What?</h2>
Before posting this, we have already told most close friends and family. If you weren't one we personally called, we apologize. We were on the phone all day on Tuesday, (what shall now be known as "The Best Tuesday Ever) and we were exhausted. It was a long and emotional day. A good emotional, but still emotional. So if we didn't call you personally, you can blame my mom. I think she called me like 7 times that day so she ate up all my phone time ;).

Grandmas be crazy.

We've gotten the same question over and over: <em>So what now?</em> Now we have more paperwork (of course). We are guessing that we will be traveling some time in July to meet our kids. Then we will leave after a week of being there and will then return after 4-6 months to bring them home. Forever. :)
<h2>Q&amp;A</h2>
We know you guys have so many questions. And we probably don't have all of the answers, so I'll just touch on a few things here:

<strong>Can we post photos?</strong> Nope. We will not be posting photos. We are not even permitted to send photos electronically, and doing so could compromise our adoption process. Ya'll will have to wait... sorry :)

<strong>Where are they from?</strong> We cannot post any country-specific (or child-specific) info and doing so could compromise our adoption. But we can tell you that they live in Europe.

<strong>Do we know their life story?</strong> We feel that this is a story best told by our children, because it's <em>their</em> story. So we'll leave it to them to decide if they'd like to tell it or not tell it. If they want to make up their own version of their story, that is fine too. It's their story to tell.

<strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">When can you meet them?</strong><span style="line-height: 1.5em;"> Well, there is a big adjustment period. Our children will need to learn how to be in a family and they'll need to adjust to having a Mom and Dad just like we will need to adjust to having children in our home. Finally. :) I'll post a lot more about this I am sure, but for now I will just say that one day, when we are all well-adjusted, you will have a chance to meet them. </span>

<strong>Is there anything you can do?</strong> Yes. Pray like you've never prayed. Pray that God prepares their hearts to join our Hartgraves family. Pray for a smooth remainder of the process. Also pray for us as we prepare to travel and become parents... and pray for our dog, Ruby. Luckily she's had my niece to break her in a bit, but she's about to nap a lot less :) ...and if we were all home by Christmas, that would be pretty amazing too ;)

<strong>Do the children know yet?</strong> Most likely not. This will depend on their caretakers, but they typically won't know until mid-way through first trip or so.

I think that's a wrap. I know I haven't posted in here a whole lot because there hasn't been much to update on. But I imagine that I'll be posting a little more frequently at least. We'll see. <em>Writing is a lot of work! :) </em>

Love you all! And we thank you for the prayers!

Proud Parents
-Thomas &amp; Ashlie
