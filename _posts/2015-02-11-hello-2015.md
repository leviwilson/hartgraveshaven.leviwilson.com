I hope you are all off to a great start to 2o15. We're nearly two months into it! Crazy how fast it's going, but also exciting for us because when you're waiting for a referral, quickly passing time is a big bonus! Tom and I are hoping and praying that in 2015 we make <em>at least</em> one trip to Europe to meet our kiddos. We really can't wait for that call. I daydream about it all the time. THE call. In my head, it's a beautiful scenario: <em>While Tom and I are actually home at the same time and it's when we least expect it. We're giggling about something and then a phone rings. It's MLJ. We think it's about a paperwork update but they actually tell us it's THE call. IN REALITY, I'm sure it will be: I 'm at work when I get the call. I scream loudly and embarrassingly with delight, as I race home forgetting to tell my boss why I raced out of the office. Probably tripping and falling before I get to my car. </em>That's probably how it will go down. Much more <em>us</em>.

As of today (Actually, exactly as of today. I didn't plan that.) we're 7 months in on the waiting process. I know, people have been like "Only 7 months!?!" Yep. We started this process over a year ago, but the time doesn't start clicking until your paperwork is accepted in country. That date for us is July 11. It's actually gone by fairly fast. We've stayed really busy. I think busy is key in this process.

We have a lot of home things we're doing to get ready. Not necessarily for the children, we're just doing things we've needed to get to for awhile while we have the time. You know, fun stuff like organizing the basement and getting our Will's in order.

For those of you who don't know, I split my work week working part time at <a href="northviewchurch.us" target="_blank">Northview Church</a> as a graphic designer and part time at <a href="kitindy.com" target="_blank">Kit</a> magazine as a managing editor. I absolutely love both of my positions. It allows me to always do something new. I really love them both. I'm a lucky gal!

Anyhow, in the last issue of Kit, I had the fantastic opportunity to work with <a href="http://www.hoosierclosets.com/" target="_blank">Hoosier Closets</a> and a kit decorator, Cassie Perry, to install a home office. Like I said, I'm a luck gal! If you want to read about it, you can <a href="http://kitindy.com/office-nook-with-a-look/" target="_blank">click here</a> BUT I'll show you the transformation. In our old house, my dad (AKA Builder Bob) made me a built-in desk. It was awesome, but we couldn't move it to our new house. So I got a "temporary" $30 fold out table from Lowes to set up shop on. Two years later, I was still working on it until Kit magazine decided to do a home office reno. "Pick me! Pick me!" I said. Below are the before and after photos. You'll see why I desperately needed help.

As you can tell, Ruby was pretty jazzed about it too. It kind of works out perfectly though. The room where I had my temporary setup is now completely empty. It's technically a dining room; however, when we find out who our kids are, we'll likely put a little playroom/art room in there so they can play while I can be in the next room doing some freelance stuff while keeping an eye on them and interacting as well. Then as the kids get older, we can turn it back into a dining room, and put a cool space for our pre-teens in the basement to hang out. It'll be perfect. AND if you're wondering, the answer is yes. Yes I have kept my new space clean and tidy. It's amazing what having a spot for everything can do to spruce up a space. On the other side of that after photo, we have a couch and a love seat. Those are Ruby's couches, but she sometimes lets Tom sit on them to balance the checkbook.

People have wondered if we are preparing bedrooms for the new members of the Hartgraves family yet. That answer is no.  Between our trip 1 to meet them, and trip 2 to pick them up, we'll have somewhere between 3-6 months of waiting (If you haven't gathered, there is a lot of waiting in adoption). It's going to be the longest wait we've ever waited. SO, we decided to save the full prepping of the spaces, toys, clothes etc. until that time between trips. That way we can get a better grasp of who they are, what they like and what their current living situation is. Do they share a room now? Do they have their own room? That sort of thing. That doesn't mean a girl can't look. I have a slight Pinterest obsession. So if you see me pinning kids rooms, it's not because we got a referral. It's because I'm obsessed.

We do feel like we might be over the first big hump of waiting. Praying we're over the hill and are heading down toward the finish line (referral). Tom and I planned a little Spring getaway that we're both very much looking forward to. After that we have the wedding of our cousin Jamie &amp; Elliot to look forward to... and if we still don't have a referral by then, we'll just stay uber busy during the summer somehow to keep our minds off of the wait!

ALSO. It's been nearly a year since we've updated our homestudy and USCIS stuff. We just got our 'to do' list for Homestudy updates and are starting to work on that. I think that consists of updated finances from W2's, multiple sets of fingerprints again,  updated medicals and some other stuff as well as another in-home visit. After that we update our USCIS for hopefully the last time before a referral and then we wait. So this new round of paperwork will help keep us busy during the wait as well. I never thought I'd appreciate the business of paperwork!

In the meantime, please continue to pray for these areas:
<ul>
	<li>That our children are happy, healthy and being well taken care of and that they have a great bond with their nanny/caretaker/eachother</li>
	<li>For peace as we wait for God's timing</li>
	<li>For wisdom as we navigate through this adoption process. I don't always put every little thing on here, but it can be a tough road to walk.</li>
	<li>For a quick and speedy perfect referral :)</li>
	<li>And please continue to pray for my sister and her children</li>
</ul>
Thanks so much for checking in. Sorry I haven't updated you in awhile, but still not much to update on at this point. I do hope that changes soon!

xoxo
