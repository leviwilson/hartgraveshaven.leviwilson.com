Hi there, folks! It has been a bit since we've updated you with a post. We've been updating the "status" blurb on the homepage as things happen, but I thought it was about time to jot a little something down.

So today (February 11, 2014), Tom picked up our officially approved home study. It's been <em>nearly</em> "officially approved" for a bit, but there were some minor back-end things and paperwork that needed to be done so we've been patiently waiting... and in the meantime we've been enjoying not having to gather paperwork.

If you're asking "What does an approved home study mean?" then you're in luck. Because I'm about to tell you. An approved home study consists of a whole bunch of information about Tom and I from finances to our personal character and also includes information about our home and lifestyle. Our Hague-licensed agency writes up our home study and basically says whether they think we are suitable to adopt or not. This is a very important initial step in the process.

Now that we have our home study approved, we are to send out our I800A Application form to the USCIS, for the US Immigration to determine if we're suitable to adopt in a Hague Convention country. We have had everything we've needed for that and were just waiting on the "official" home study. We'll be shooting the USCIS items off this week since we now have our official home study. Soon we'll get appointment times from the USCIS to have us go get fingerprinted (we've been fingerprinted like 3 or 4 times already I think, but we'll do another for good measure!). We're praying our USCIS goes swiftly and smoothly, because once that is approved and final, then we will be sending that in with our dossier to our beautiful European country! Then Europe will determine if we're suitable to adopt, and we'll go on a list to wait for our referral.

We also just received our FBI background checks in the mail. As expected, Tom and I are boring.  The FBI checks are part of what goes back in the dossier, along with other stuff. Honestly, I don't really have it all straight, but Tom does. It's a lot to keep track of and I've been really busy and overwhelmed lately with freelance projects and career swaps and things of that nature.... so I'm glad one of us is on top of things.

While we're patiently waiting on our USCIS approval, we'll be getting our dossier all straight and together and ready to send. We're <em>hoping</em> to have our dossier sent by April or early May. Might be a significant stretch, but it would be lovely to have it done by then.
<h2>On another note,</h2>
Tom and I continue to be speechless and grateful for your support and generosity. We'll receive a donation on our <a href="https://www.adopttogether.org/hartgraveshaven">AdoptTogether</a> account or a donation in the mail and it just warms our hearts each time. I am in awe of your generosity and am so thankful that The Lord is providing (as He always does). I am just so taken back at how many of you have a special spot in your heart for our family and our story and how you continue to pray for us and our journey. Love you all!
