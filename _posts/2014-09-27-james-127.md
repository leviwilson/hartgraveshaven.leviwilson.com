<blockquote><em>Religion that God our Father accepts as pure and faultless is this: to look after orphans and widows in their distress and to keep oneself from being polluted by the world. James 1:27</em>

&nbsp;</blockquote>
I have read that verse so many times in the last year. It's kind of an adoption staple. Many adoptive families (including us) have referred to it when they say they felt lead to adopt. I feel strongly about this verse in that it does call all of God's children to look after the vulnerable; however, to me, when I read it previously I always only thought of the orphans across the ocean that needed a family. I still think of our children in Europe when I read this verse; however, it also now has a new meaning.

As many of you know, my Brother-in-law tragically passed away on September 16 from a tragic accident. He leaves behind his 3 beautiful children and my sister. My courageous sister, is a widow at 33. We can ask why, and we can get angry— and all those questions and feelings would be legitimate and justified. The fact is, we will never know why. I know that God has this (Jeremiah 29:11), but that doesn't mean the current circumstance doesn't break our hearts. I cannot stop thinking about that family.  My sweet twin nieces just turned 5 and my adorable and sensitive nephew will be 6 in November. Now my strong sister will have to find a way to move forward when all she probably feels like doing is collapsing...my heart physically aches for them.

Uncle Tom and I drove Hunter to the funeral that Saturday. As we passed his house Hunter said, "My Daddy isn't here to help us anymore," and my spirit broke into a million little pieces for this little guy, sitting in his camouflage booster in the the backseat of our car. With a lump in my throat, I thought of James 1:27 again. I said "Hunter, there are so many people that love you and loved your daddy. There will be so many people to help you do things. Pappy and Papa will help, Uncle Tom and Uncle Levi and all of Daddy's friends will help. It will be okay. I promise." Then I held his hand, blew him kisses and patted his leg and told him how much I loved him and Uncle Tom and Hunter told me to stop being weird :)

Tom and I headed back to Indy on Saturday evening. We actually left just minutes before a huge storm hit. I called on Sunday (and about 50+ times since then.... It's really hard to be away right now!) and asked how everything was going. Dad said on their way home from church they saw Justin (we love you, Justin!) cleaning up limbs that had fallen down in the Howard yard so the family went over there to help and clean up. Aunt Jerri and Hunter planted some flowers. People cleared limbs and brush and burned them up. And I again thought of James 1:27. My sister and her children are having a hard time (severe understatement), and I think they all, and my nephew in particular, need to me reminded that people are there. There to help do some of the things Daddy used to do.

I thank you all for your prayers for our family. For helping out. For staying with Danae. And for the food you brought.

So often when things like this happen we all pray and touch base for awhile and then slowly life happens and we kind of fade off. It's okay, we're human and we get busy. HOWEVER, I put together a little something to help remind us. Just print it out and put it somewhere where you will see it, like the bathroom mirror, the dash of your car, on your computer screen or just save the image and use it as your phone screen. We hope it reminds you to pray for Danae and the kids, AND since the verse is for widows <em>and</em> orphans- It'd be really swell if it reminded you to also pray for our adoption and the many other widows and orphans around the globe.

Christopher Scott, We loved you so much. You were always such a kind, crazy silly soul. We will all look after Danae and the Kids for you. I will miss your smile and your beard, Zac Brown. I hope you enjoyed holding Baby Jacob for the first time :) I love you and may you rest in peace.
