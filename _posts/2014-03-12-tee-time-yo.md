Hi ya'll! As you may or may not have seen on Facebook, we're selling some <a title="T-shirts" href="http://hartgraveshaven.mkweddingstory.com/?page_id=242">T-shirts</a>. We decided to sell shirts for a few reasons. 1) I have always been and always will be, a girl with about 23 too many t-shirts in my drawers. 2) There's nothing more stellar than a big group photo with an adorable brown-eyed European or two smiling big with all of the people that helped bring them home to their mama and daddy wearing the same shirt! 3) Most of our t-shirts are a bad shade of royal blue with a horseshoe on them. GO COLTS! So we thought we should add a little variety to our tee wardrobe.

There is also a story behind the t-shirts, and if you want to skip the story feel free. As you may have noticed I tend to get long-winded. Adoption in general isn't a super affordable task, so a good portion of the people who adopt domestically and internationally have to either fundraise or sell kidneys on the black market. Because Tom and I have had enough surgeries in our 3.5 years of marriage, we decided that we'd fundraise.

Our agency (<a href="http://www.mljadoptions.com/">MLJ</a>) gives us a huge packet when you sign the contract, and in it is a lot of fundraising ideas. We've also ordered (and I've read it 3 times already) a book called "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Adopt-Without-Debt-Creative-Adoption/dp/0983539820">Adopting without Debt</a>" by Julie Gumm. Both the book and MLJ talk about selling t-shirts; however in MLJ's packet they talk specifically about a printer in Holland Michigan that gives discounts to people printing shirts as an adoption fundraiser. Only I couldn't for the life of me find the name of the printer anywhere when I was going through the materials to get costs on shirts. There is a <a href="http://www.addingaburden.com/">blog</a> I read often, and they had the cutest shirts when they adopted their son from Russia... so I messaged Jillian Burden and said "where did you get your shirts printed? I really like the style...." She said "A small little shop in Holland, Michigan. They are friends of ours." I <del>said</del> typed SHUT UP! So I called this shop (SonScreens in Holland MI) and I talked to the the guy who answered and he said they do adoption t's but I needed to talk to the owner. Then he told me "Yeah they just got home from __________ (insert name of the very same beautiful European country we are adopting from) with their twin boys. Again I said "SHUT UP!" I called back a few days later and talked to the owner for about 40 minutes about their adoption experience, her boys, how they're adjusting/attaching... and then I talked for about 5 minutes on T-shirts. Anyways, I thought it was pretty awesome, and I hope she knows I may be calling on her for more than T-shirts. It was great to connect with her. AND they're pretty great when it comes to T's, so that's a bonus! So what I'm saying is, we're <em>pretty much</em> destined to order our t's from SonScreens in Holland.

As for the T-shirts, we hope you enjoy the design. There are some companies that have pre-made t-shirts that you can pick and sell from their website to help with your adoption costs, but we kind of prefer simple and I thought I'd rather personalize it by designing it myself. We wanted a shirt people might actually want to wear/purchase that didn't scream "THIS IS A FUNDRAISER SHIRT!" Also, Indiana-inspired swag is all the rage here in Indy. Seriously, there are shirts, notebooks, bracelets - everything Indiana. And we get it, Indiana is quite cool. So hopefully you all think the shirts are cool and wearable. Don't feel obligated to buy one though if you don't like it.... or if you're from like Oregon or something. But we did Indiana also because that is where "HOME" will be for our child(ren). and the Word below "home" is also "home" but it's pronounced "dom" in our child(ren)'s native language.

So that's the story.

If you want one, be sure to pre-order so I know how many to order. We will be ordering a FEW extra but not many, so if you want one, please pre-order. They will be available at our fundraiser on <a title="Dinner + Silent Auction" href="http://hartgraveshaven.mkweddingstory.com/?page_id=256">May 3</a> Â and <a title="T-shirts" href="http://hartgraveshaven.mkweddingstory.com/?page_id=242">click here</a> to read all about the t's and their prices/payment/pickup (May 3 isn't the only pickup option).

Thanks again. We love you all!

XOXO
