Our dossier has been <em>nearly </em>complete for awhile. We're new to this process, but I've already gathered that while "nearly" complete, that still doesn't give you a frame of reference. That ONE thing you're waiting on can take forever to get there. Or the last little thing you have to do can take a lot longer than anticipated.

We received our USCIS approval on April 1st. Once that arrived, we had everything needed to complete our dossier. We just had to get that last USCIS page notarized and then take everything to get apostilled. That was all the easy part. We also have to have two original copies just incase anything gets lost in the mail (please pray ours does NOT get lost!) In addition to the 2nd original that we keep, we have to have a printed copy and an electronic copy for our agency. No big deal, right? Well, it is.

The apostille is a cover sheet and a staple with a sticker around the staple, cover page and the last page of the document (which could be 2 pages or 15 pages) and you have to keep the sticker in tact. You can't really scan in sheets through the feeder, so you have to do each page individually. There are a lot of pages and a lot of stickers. It took me over 3 hours and naturally when you need technology to work, it chooses to not. In the middle of my copying and scanning I had to:
<ul>
	<li>Change the printer ink</li>
	<li>Restock our paper supply</li>
	<li>Turn the printer on/off/unplug it about 8 times</li>
	<li>Refill my stapler</li>
	<li>Fix Tom's stapler that I broke when my stapler was out of staples</li>
	<li>Replace the batteries for my wireless mouse</li>
	<li>Replaced the batteries for my mouse again because apparently the ones I put in were only partially charged (or perhaps ruined).</li>
</ul>
It was a good time. Ruby had fun also.

BUT today, Wednesday, April 8, 2014, Tom and I drove downtown and plopped our official dossier, a dossier copy and a dossier electronic copy on that desk at MLJ. So yes. <strong>Our dossier is complete and submitted. Amen. </strong>

Let the waiting begin....

We should officially be on the waiting list in roughly 2 months. Our dossier will take about a month to get translated and then will be reviewed by the Ministry of Justice (MOJ) in-country before we're put on the list officially. So now we will wait. For a year+ for our referral. Please pray that our hearts remain content during this period of waiting.

Thanks!

<em>p.s. Our adoption t-shirts should be arriving at our house this week. I'm so excited to toss one on. I <del>think I might</del> will live in it. Seriously. I love t-shirts! </em>
